# 📌 Blog Post Card #

## 📖 Project Overview ##

This project is a **blog post card** built as part of the **FreeCodeCamp “Styling Backgrounds and Borders” lab**.  
The goal of the lab was to practice using CSS to style backgrounds, borders, images, and interactive elements while following specific structural requirements.


The card presents an astronomy-themed blog post featuring:
- a cover image
- a title and short excerpt
- a call-to-action button

The design focuses on clean layout, visual hierarchy, and simple hover interactions.
